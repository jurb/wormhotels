# Exploring reachability of points of interest for all addresses in a city by foot

[Online version of the notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jurb/wormhotels/blob/master/Having%20a%20look%20at%20the%20worm%20hotels%20in%20Amsterdam.ipynb).

In this notebook I use open data from the municipality of Amsterdam to find out how worm hotels (neighbourhood compost stations) are distributed around the city. Using [OSRM](http://project-osrm.org/) I calculated the walking distance to all worm hotels for all addresses in Amsterdam. The analysis includes Leaflet maps and functions which calcultate information about the nearest worm hotel given an address in Amsterdam.
